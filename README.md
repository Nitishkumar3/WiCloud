Wi-Cloud is a lightweight script for creating a Local Wireless Cloud Server, accessible via any modern web browser. With this script, you can easily store and access files across a network. By setting up a basic Apache or Nginx server and installing Wi-Cloud, you can create your own home media server.

## Installation

- Set up an Apache / Nginx Webserver and Install PHP. Alternatively use XAMPP for easy setup.
- Copy Script files to htdocs.
- Allow Firewall access and Open port 80.
- Spin up the PHP Server.
- Get the Local Public IP of the machine. Use the following command in Terminal, Windows - "ipconfig", Linux and Mac - "ifconfig".
- Connect other devices to the same Network and Use the IP Address to access Dashboard where the files could be managed.
